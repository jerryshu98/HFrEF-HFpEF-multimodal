# HFrEF vs HFpEF Classification from Chest X-rays

This repository contains the code for our study:  
**"Discriminating HFrEF vs HFpEF from Chest Radiographs: Mitigating Demographic Performance Gaps via Augmentation and Multimodal Fusion."**

The code is used to **train deep learning models, perform subgroup analysis, and validate results** for classifying heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) vs preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) from chest X-rays.  
We also implement fairness-oriented methods such as **data augmentation** and **multimodal fusion** with demographic features to reduce performance disparities across subgroups.
